# LA 1992/London 1780

***LA 1992/London 1780: Sounding Out a Crowd*** is an exhibition highlighting the eleven original singles from the album, *Never Say Die: A Sonic Tribute to the LA 1992 Rebellion*, a compilation of student sound projects inspired by studying the representation of two urban uprisings: the Gordon Riots of 1780 in Charles Dickens’ Barnaby Rudge, and the one that occurred more than twenty-five years ago in students’ own neighborhood.

Anchoring the exhibition are listening panels that juxtapose two images of civil unrest in the linked cities of the project, interlaced with strips of wheatpasted single covers designed by students. These are further detailed in a collection of album art with their inspiration. The exhibition stages the listener’s experience of the album amid a fragmented visual and spatial language that continually suggests the task of collecting and reassembling
perspectives.

A large community map, *Resounding 1992: A Sonic Map of South LA*, geolocates the archive of scavenged sounds above a base map detailing the destruction of the LA Rebellion, revealing proximities between the past and the present of students’ lived space. Each annotated location corresponds to a CD case in the accompanying sound collection, and when opened, the CD cases reveal liner notes with hand-drawn maps and statements from students about their found sounds. When closed, all together the covers form an image of the raven Grip, a crucial symbol in the novel. Visitors to the exhibition at Foshay were invited to contribute to the map with their own sound or memory that represents what the community means to them.

***LA 1992/London 1780*** was generously supported by the UCLA Urban Humanities Initiative, Dickens Project, and USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative. It exhibited throughout Winter, Spring, and Summer 2018-2019 at the Foshay Learning Center, UCLA English Graduate Conference (Royce Hall), UHI Alumni Salon (DeCafe), and UCSC Dickens Universe (Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery).

*This project was produced for LitLabs LA with Jacqueline Barrios.*
